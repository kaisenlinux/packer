# `setintersection` Function

The `setintersection` function takes multiple sets and produces a single set
containing only the elements that all of the given sets have in common.
The new set is referred to as the _intersection_. 

```hcl
setintersection(sets...)
```

## Examples

```shell-session
> setintersection(["a", "b"], ["b", "c"], ["b", "d"])
[
  "b",
]
```

The given arguments are converted to sets, so the result is also a set and
the ordering of the given elements is not preserved.
