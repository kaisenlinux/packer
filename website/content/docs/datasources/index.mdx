# Data sources

Data sources let Packer fetch data to use in a template, including information defined outside of Packer.

Refer to the [`data`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/datasources) block documentation to learn more about working with data sources. The documentation also contains details about each type of data source.

Data sources are only available in HCL2 templates and require Packer `v1.7.0` and newer.
