Separate paths with a forward slash (`/`), especially when using relative paths in your configuration. 
Windows uses backward slashes (`\`) to separate paths, but Packer only recognizes `/` as path
separators when it creates builds from any non-Windows system. Packer also treat backslashes as plain text, which could lead to errors.
